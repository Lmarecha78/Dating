<h2>How to set the development mode</h2>

<p>To set the development mode, please edit <code>~/_YOUR-PROTECTED-FOLDER/app/configs/config.ini</code><br />
Replace <code>"environment = production"</code> by <code>"environment = development"</code> at the beginning of the file.<br /><br />

After that, it is also better to clear your browser cache (CTRL+F5).</p>
