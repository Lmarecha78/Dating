## Overview

**pH7 Dating CMS** is a **Social/Dating CMS** written in **Object-Oriented** PHP (*OOP*) with a **MVC** architecture (Model-View-Controller).

It is designed with the **KISS** principle in mind, and the all source code can be read and understood in minutes. For a better flexibility, the software uses **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) abstraction which allows the choice of the database. The principle of development is **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds (not duplicate code).

This Free and Open Source **Social Dating Site Builder** wants to be low resource-intensive, powerful, stable and secure. The software also comes with 30 system modules and is based on **pH7Framework** *(written specifically for this project)* that has over 52 packages.

To summarize, **pH7CMS** gives you **the perfect ingredients** to create the **best dating service** or **social networking** website on the World Wide Web!
