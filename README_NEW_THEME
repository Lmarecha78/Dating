*** THE MISSION ***

My goal here is to make a new theme for Ph7cms. The current theme is usable but I really want it to look and feel a different. 

*** HOW ***

Most of this will be done using CSS but there will be some rearanging involved, for example the top and bottom menu template files. 
We will need to rearrange the order and in some cases the location of the nav bars links to the other pages in order to allow our 
new CSS rules to work. This in turn will require some changes in the routes scrip. 

*** MAYBE *** 

I would like to add a few more feilds to the Current ones available in the users profile, this is an option now
however these additions are limited to text or number feilds. I would like the ability to add radio and checkbox,
and button input types, however this is a little more involved will require changes in view forms, models and also
controllers so this may be an extra I might include at the end of the project.

*** CURRENT LAYOUT (USER SIDE)***

All the search pages should be linked on there mother catagory pages not seprate links that add extra confusion to navigation.

There is a lot going on in this accounts tab that could be better handled. One page (profile) with these other links found there! There is 
no benifit fo having them all here this way, it confuses the way you can use the menu, it would be faster and more orginised to have these
links all on one main profile page.

Also update/refraze some user preset messages, Ph7 has done an incredable job but english not being his mother tounge there are
always going to be grammer mistakes in these responses, they are small things like "Never send anybody the money". No "the" needed 
Only problemis the size of the file they are in is 15,159 lines long!!! This is a long job and requires lots of concentration. Its 
given me a headache more than once and you feel like you are not making any progress!

******************************************************
Add Uk phone number support (11 digits start with 0) -> changing following bellow in _protected/app/configs/config.ini (after install)
for preinstall the devloper Ph7 would need to add this to his install script (I will request at some point)

[validate]
phone.pattern = "^[0][1-9]\d{1}$|^[0]\d{10}$"

********************************************************

These are user configable and work by putting header, body, footer templates together, the body being the users own so very easy to include 
these files below, we have added a membership page to the list!
