*** THE MISSION ***

My goal here is to create a new theme for Ph7-Social-Dating-CMS by @pH-7 "https://github.com/pH-7". The current theme is 
nice but I really want something that looks and feel a bit different. 

*** HOW I PLAN TO DO THIS ***

Most the desired changes can be achived using CSS. There will be some rearanging involved, for example the top and bottom menu's 
template files put the page links in to dropdown group so we will need to rearrange the order some of these are currently found in
and in some cases the location of the links will need moving to other pages in order to allow our new CSS rules to work. This in
turn will require some changes in the routes scrip. 

*** MAYBE AT THE END *** 

I would like to add a few more feilds to the Current ones available in the users profile, this is an option available
now however the options are limited to text or number input types. I would like the ability to add radio, checkbox, button
and select input types. This is a little more involved as will require changes in view form, model, controller  and database 
so this may be an extra I might include at the end of the project.

*** CURRENT LAYOUT (USER SIDE)***

There are a lot of search pages that would be easier to use if they was displayed as a search box on the catagories own page
and not separate links in the nav bar, when used separately they add extra confusion and clutter to the navigation bar.

		       |--> Logout

There is a lot going on in this accounts tab that could be better handled. One page (profile) with these other links found displayed there! 
There is no benifit having them here in this way, it confuses and slows down the way you use the navigation, it would be faster and more
organised to have these links all on one main profile page. This way we can also empathise the pages we want free users to see, like 
upgading and paid members there current membership expire date.

Also update/refraze some user preset messages in app/langs/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/global.po, Ph-7 has done an incredable job but english 
is not his mother tounge so there was always going to be slight translation differances in grammar, this are small things like 
"Never send anybody the money". There is no need for the word "no" in this sentance and breaks english grammar! The only issue is
file they are in is 15,159 lines long!!! This is a long job and requires lots of concentration and has given me headache more than
once and you really feel like you are not making any progressat all!

******************************************************

Add Uk phone number support (11 digits start with 0) -> changing following bellow in _protected/app/configs/config.ini (after install)
for preinstall the devloper Ph-7 would need to add this to his install script giving a set up choice between UK/US for example.
(I will request this at some point in the future).

[validate]
phone.pattern = "^[0][1-9]\d{1}$|^[0]\d{10}$"

********************************************************

These are user configable pages and work by putting header, body, footer templates together, the body being the users custom page
contents so its very easy to include these files below in to a theme and almost include themselves, we have also added a membership
page to the list this is going to be a main feature on new side menu!

ABOUT SUB MENU
-->About
-->Help
-->Blog
-->Affiliate
-->Contact
-->Partners ---> Ph7cms software will be a Featured non removable link (I've got some ideas on how to make sure it can not be removed) 
-->Links
-->Jobs --> rename "Jobs" -> "Carriers"

HELP SUB MENU
-->F.A.Q
-->Terms of Service --> rename "Terms of Service" -> "Terms & Condions"
-->Privacy --> rename "Privacy" -> "Data Protection"
-->Legal Notice --> rename "Legal Notice" -> "Contract" 

OTHER PAGES
-->Memberships ---> Top nav bar (floating bold bright "UPGRADE" link)

-->EXTRA STYLE JOBS THAT NEED DOING

Add Ph7 Software name and website links will be moved from bottom center to far right and non removable!!! (part of the theme's licance).


***************************** WHAT NOW ********************************

Next comes a list of the required files we will have to make changes too.
